- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @harry22
I'm passionate about Cloud Network Operations and constantly exploring learning new technologies to streamline and automate infrastructure. Currently, I am diving deep into **CI/CD** pipelines, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**.

My journey revolves around learning and applying technologies to automate processes and improve the efficiency of cloud and network operations. I'm excited to collaborate, share knowledge, and contribute to open-source projects in these areas.

ðŸ”§ **Technologies I'm starting  learning/working with:**
- **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration and Deployment)
- **Docker** & **Kubernetes**
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Cloud Platforms** (Azure)
- **Cloud Networking** and **DevOps Practices**

Feel free to check out my repositories, where I share my learning, experiments, and contributions. Let's connect, collaborate, and grow together! Cheerz!!!
